A demo of Razorpay Node Sdk with React.js showcasing the payments and refunds scenarios: 

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Resolution-1/react-razorpay.git
cd react-razorpay
```

## Prerequisites

> Get your Razorpay API keys [`key_id` and `key_secret`] for test environment variables from here, [https://dashboard.razorpay.com/#/app/keys](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/#/app/keys)

## Installation

### For Working

```bash
npm install or yarn install
```

Copy the contents from `sample.env` to `.env` and replace the dumb characters(`xxxxx`) with your Razorpay `key` and the Razorpay Password, which you will be creating soon(local default is already there in the file).

```bash
npm start or yarn start
```
